# RemoteApps-Linux
## Assumptions
###### This tutorial makes the following assumes 
* that you either have access to a remote app server and `.rdp` files
* or you have the ability to set up a remote app server (setting up an RDP server is outside of the scope of this tutorial)

## Prerequisites
* Icons - I reccomend _Papirus_ since it has over 5,000 icons. Chances are you'll find one for your app. If not, the internet is your friend.[Gnome-Look](https://www.gnome-look.org/s/Gnome/p/1166289)
